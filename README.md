## Object-Oriented Design and Programming module - Assignment 3

### Team members

### Project tasks

- Decide package structure
- Assign responsibility for classes and/or methods
- Generate classes and interfaces with empty methods (following skeleton code given in assigment)
- Write failing tests
- Write code to pass tests

### Git collaboration strategy

Agree on an approach for working with Git. Suggestion, something based on (a simple version of) Git Flow:

- Project has a `master` branch that only ever contains working, stable code
- Each team member will branch off `master` to work on an area of responsbility (a feature)
- Feature branch naming convention suggestion `feature/short-description` e.g. `feature/empty-sea`
- Team member regularly merges `master` into their feature branch to keep up to date with possible changes in `master`
- When feature branch is ready to share with the team, do a pull request into `master`
- Another team member should review the new code contained in the pull request and merge if OK (this will help us all keep up to date with each others' ongoing work)

### Getting started
